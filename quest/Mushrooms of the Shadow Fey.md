Mudar's Investigations:
Okay to share the following information with the party:

"I have been tracking Shar and her counterparts in the feywild"
"Long ago she fought against Chauntea over the border of the Shadowfell and the Material Plane. Since then she has been covertly trying to expand the realm of the Shadowfell. She is most recently making allies in the feywild. She knows that she cannot push the shadowfell into the material plane directly without drawing the attention of Chauntea again.
"My investigations show that Shar is attempting to penetrate into the feywild, and thus would surround the material plane, from there she can suffocate the material plane of all things good"
Shar's allies in the Feywild are not evil, but just chaotic and want to bring minor mayhem to their region, but they do not know the utter darkness that will befall the material plane if Shar is allowed to penetrate into the Fey.
"I thought this was the only mushroom crossing Shar was farming, but it appears there is a crossing even further along at Isbrook, wherever that is."
The faun at the center of the town is the sister of Ehmyr, and has been working for Shar much longer.
Ehmyr seemed uncertain of what joining the feywild and shadowfell would actually mean.


Session 2:
Shadow Troll

Session 3: Shadow Ranger

Session 4:
First thing you notice is there are lots of cats, mostly sleeping, one of them is licking himself inappropriately and stops to look at you as you enter the door.



""Please come in, I've been expecting you. My soul is trapped in this desolate place. ""

""I was expecting you when Shar came to Isbrook. She was very displeased with Ansibelle and sent Shadow Helm and Shadow Tonwyn after you. I followed them down the trail, but snuck away here to this abandoned treehouse I have been using as my refuge and spirit ship where I take my mushrooms""

""Like the others, I have been here since I have existed, and I shall continue to exist here for my eternity""

""Ansibelle is working to grow mushrooms for Shar. I was working there with... well all of you. The shadow Ansibelle has captured the real Ansibelle and is holding her here in the shadowfell. She took me to Isbrook in the feywild to use my music to charm her""

""It was after that I began eating the mushrooms, and came to realize very strange things about the nature of our reality."" (if asked about the nature of reality, she says "it would take many lifetimes to explain, and even then... you would not understand.")

""She has turned the hut to the crossing that will overtake the material. The mushrooms that grow here will cause horribly bad trips if taken in the Fey or Material, and cause the veil to become thin""

""You must destroy the shadow Ansibelle and the hut, and return to the real Ansibelle to the feywild to restore the village.  Mae, the fate of Isbrook is in your hooves!""

""Shadow Bro-Kag is Shadow Ansibelle's personal body guard. She grows the mushrooms in her hut in the center of town.""

""The real Ansibelle was taken behind the waterfall of sorrows. I have not journeyed there, but Mae knows the way.""

""After you rescue Ansibelle, go to Isbrook. You should be able to pass as us, as from afar. Somehow you'll have to get past BroKag and get enough mushrooms for a heroic dose for each of you to get back. Consume at least 4 caps each, more for you brokag. It will take about 30 minutes to lift off. In that time, you must destroy the hut, or else the veil will grow even thinner with your trip.""



""You should rest here, you'll need your wits about you""



Mae, take the the lyre of building (TCE131), and use it as you gain entry to the hut in the center of isbrook.

Towyn, our little... Our little... Fairy head. See this couldron? This couldron (of rebirth, tce122) can raise the dead. But at what cost? If you remove this item from this place you will never heal from the damage this place has taken from you.

Helm: I give you this cat to watch over you. He will protect you when you need him most. (Secret, casts revivify when you hit 0 hp)
