# Flanking

A creature is flanked once two melee attackers are on opposite sides of the creature. The opposite sides are determined by drawing an imaginary line between the two attackers. If the line goes through a space the creature inhabits, then the creature is flanked. When a creature is flanked, all melee attacks against the creature are done with advantage. Ranged attacks cannot flank or take advantage of flanking.

Spiritual weapon cannot cause or take advantage of flanking.
