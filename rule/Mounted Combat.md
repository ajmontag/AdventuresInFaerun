# Mounted Combat 

- Half of your movement to mount or dismount from a mount.
- You can only mount or dismount once per turn (no mounting, riding, and then unmounting in the same turn).
- Unintelligent mounts (all mounts we are working with for the most part):
  - Basically a part of the player, although their movement does not count against the player's movement.
  - The mount itself can perform either the dodge, disengage, or dash actions only. This does not count against the player's action, and the mount cannot attack.
- Intelligent mounts (dragons, etc)
  - They move on their own turn, and are controlled by the DM, but may be communicated with to request actions
  - The player is just along for the ride.
- The player is technically at the center point of the mount, either the intersection on a large creature or the center square on a huge creature.
- For huge creatures, the player must use a weapon with reach in order to attack, and the inverse is true for attackers.
- Mounts can be attacked separately from players.
- For positioning, follow the center of mass method.
