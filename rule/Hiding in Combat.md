# Hiding in Combat

## TL;DR

- Make a Stealth check. By default, this requires an action.
- This is contested by the opposing Passive Perception
  - Additionally, the opponent can use the search action to roll a perception check to find the enemy.
- A character who has found the opponent can use a free action to point out the enemy
  - This adds +5 to the passive perception, and gives advantage on any rolls due to a search action.
  - This does not stack.
- Once a character is found, either via the search action or passive perception, it is as if the character did not hide to the character who has found the hider.
- If you succeed in hiding, you have advantage on attack rolls. Opponents have disadvantage when attacking you.
- If the attacker does not know your position, they need to pick a square to attack. 
  - This is up to DM discretion, but should generally be common sense.
  - If an attacker saw you dive into bushes, they know your general area.
  - If you then snuck in the bushes for another 15 feet, however, then they don't know your general area, and have to guess.
- You may give away your position while hiding by attacking, sneezing, etc. In this case, you retain advantage, and attacks still have disadvantage, however the target square will always be correct. 
- If you wish to move after hiding, you must make another stealth check to avoid giving away your location. 
- The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. 

## Details

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section.


The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.

An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

Passive Perception. When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.

What Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in "The Environment."


Unseen Attackers and Targets
Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden–both unseen and unheard–when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.



When the above quote says "give away your position", that only means that enemies can target you now, correct? It doesn't mean they can actually see you, because you are still heavily obscured. Which means your attacks continue to get advantage until you are no longer considered heavily obscured? A: Correct. If your position is given away, you can now be targeted, but you still have advantage.
