Not all cultures approve of farijuana use. In such communities, possession, use and purchase can be penalized by fines or even jail time. Some communities, recognize its medicinal properties, but their treatment of recreational use varies wildly.

Being affected by any mental effect eliminates the affects of farijuana.
