# Satchel of Candlekeep
_Wonderous Item, very rare_

This waxed linnen satchel contains two main compartments, one of which is empty.
Any item placed in the empty compartment will be teleported to a predetermined location in Candlekeep after a short rest. 
The size of this compartment is that of a large tome, about 6" x 10" x 14". 

The target location is determined by the last place the satchel was kept overnight at Candlekeep. 

Typically those adventuring outside of Candlekeep will coordinate with the Avowed to watch the location in their absense, and catalog daily journal entries or other artifacts needing further research.
