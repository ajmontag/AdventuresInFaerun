# Scribe
_Loyal servant of Deneir, Avowed of Candlekeep, Scribe to the deepest corners of the universe_

![](Scribe.png)

Scribe stands tallâ€”broad shouldered with sparkling amber hair. His piercing hazel eyes command attention, and his well-groomed beard reminds you of a scholar.  Upon the pack on his back is strapped a shield, albeit never been used.  Slung carefully over his left shoulder is an oiled cloth satchel, a quill peeking out. 

"Pardon my delay, I rode through the night to I am scribe of Candlekeep, here to fullfill my oath to defend and protect Candlekeep and all the knowledge in this universe."

## Secret Stuff
Scribe had a given name that he lost when he became an Avowed servant of Candlekeep at a young age. He began his time at Candlekeep training as a Cleric of Deneir under his mentor Geas Melvin, who is a father figure, and keeper of Scribe's given name. During scribes work, he did extensive research and discovered a magic mushroom hiden in the pages of an ancient tome. The tome spoke of an ancient mycilleal mat that underlies the universe, and after consuming the mushroom, Scribe found himself on the Astral plane, and realized his connection to the ancient mycilleal mat, and all conciousness. Upon returning from the astral plane, and being confronted by Deneir, Scribe convinces Deneir that he should continue to learn about the ancient one, and document his findings in the library.
