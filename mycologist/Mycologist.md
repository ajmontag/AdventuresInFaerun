# Mycologist
_Profession, Skill, Craft_

**This is playtest material**

A mycologist is someone who studies fungi and mushrooms.
They will generally search for wild mushrooms, identify them, and cultivate them. 
Both wild and cultivated mushrooms can be consumed for their effects. 


## Mycology Skill 
You can use an *Arcana* or *Nature* skills for mycology.


## Spore Prints
A spore print can be taken of a fresh mushroom and can be preserved indefinately. You can save a spore print for future identification, or cultivation. 
To take a spore print, remove the cap of the mushroom and place it over a piece of parchment. Let it sit undisturbed for 8 hours, then remove the mushroom cap. You can still use the fresh mushroom, but you cannot make another spore print.


## Identifying Mushrooms
Each mushroom you come across in the wild has an identification DC.
Roll a mycology check. If you have both the fresh mushroom and a spore print, add +2 to the roll. 

Common (Level 0): DC 10, can be identified without special tools or books. 
Uncommon (Level 1): DC 14, requires a level 1 mushroom identificaion book (item, common, 20 gp)
Rare (Level 2): DC 16, requires a level 2 mushroom identificaion book (item, uncommon, 50 gp)
Very Rare (Level 3): DC 18, requires a level 3 mushroom identificaion book (item, rare, 200 gp)
Legendary (Level 4): DC 20, requires a level 4 mushroom identificaion book (item, very rare, 500 gp)
Artifact (Level 5): same as level 4

TODO what to roll to see if you find anything? Perception? Mycology?

No. | Mushroom | Effect | Environment | Cultivation DC

## Searching for mushrooms
Mushrooms will grow almost anywhere, but finding them is a different matter. Some only grow in extreme climates. To search for mushrooms, spend at least 10 minutes searching an area. 


## Cultivating Mushrooms
Cultivating mushrooms requires Mycologist's Tools (common, 50 gp).
There are two stages to cultivating mushrooms: spawning and fruiting.


### Spawning
Spawing is the process of using a spore print to create mushroom spawn. This process takes one hour of active time, and one tenday to complete. 
A small amount of nutrient material is sterialized in water in a glass jar, and cooled. Then, a small portion of the spore print is placed into the jar. After the tenday has passed, roll a mycology check  against the cultivation DC to see if you were successful. Since a spore print can be used an indefinate number of times, many mycologists will create redundant spawn jars to lessen the chance of failure. A spawn jar will last an indefinate amount of time. 


### Fruiting 
Fruting is the process of adding spawn to a nutrient material fruiting block, and letting it grow to maturity. One spawn jar can create up to 8 fruiting blocks. 50 gp worth of nutrient material is required per fruiting block. This takes one hour of active time, and one tenday to complete. Fruting blocks are bulky, and weigh 10 pounds. They cannot be moved during the fruiting process. 

Fruiting done indoors is reliable. The mushrooms will either produce in a tenday, or they fail. After the tenday has passed, roll a mycology check against the cultivation DC to see if you were successful. The fruiting blocks cannot be re-used. 

Fruiting outdoors is more sparatic. After the first tenday has passed, roll a mycology check against the cultivation DC to see if you were successful. If you were successful, you have a 1 in 10 chance of having mushrooms at your mushroom patch on any given day. 


### Harvesting
If successful, each fruiting block will produce 1d8 mushrooms, which can be used fresh or dried.
